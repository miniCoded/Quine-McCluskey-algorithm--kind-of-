#Quine-McCluskey algorithm
-

An implementation of the Quine-McCluskey algorithm for boolean expresion simplification.

It was made to work with the Bool_exp thingy I made, so I would recommend you to add it to wahtever you're doing.

It can take 3 inputs:
- A boolean expression
- The bit length and amount of variables
- A truth table and the bit length
